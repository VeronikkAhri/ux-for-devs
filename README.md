# UX for Devs

Welcome to **UX for Devs**, a lightweight course focused on user experience principles for developers. The course is entirely documentation-basedâ€”there is no framework or code to install. Everything you need is in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder.

## Getting Started

1. Browse the documentation in order or jump to topics that interest you:
   - [Introduction](docs/introduction.md)
   - [UX Principles](docs/principles.md)
   - [Designing for Different Users](docs/user-groups.md)
   - [UX Tips for Developers](docs/dev-tips.md)
   - [Examples and Exercises](docs/examples.md)
   - [Accessibility Basics](docs/accessibility.md)
   - [Usability Testing](docs/usability-testing.md)
   - [Use Cases and Trends](docs/use-cases.md)
2. Each file is written in Markdown so you can read it directly on GitHub or in any text editor.

This repository is ideal for developers who want practical guidance on building user-friendly interfaces with clear, concise examples.
