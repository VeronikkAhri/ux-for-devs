# UX for Devs

Welcome to **UX for Devs**, a lightweight course focused on user experience principles for developers. The course is entirely documentation-basedâ€”there is no framework or code to install. Everything you need is in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder.

## Getting Started

1. Browse the documentation in order or jump to topics that interest you:
   - [Introduction](docs/introduction.md)
   - [UX Principles](docs/principles.md)
   - [Designing for Different Users](docs/user-groups.md)
   - [UX Tips for Developers](docs/dev-tips.md)
   - [Examples and Exercises](docs/examples.md)
   - [Accessibility Basics](docs/accessibility.md)
   - [Usability Testing](docs/usability-testing.md)
   - [Use Cases and Trends](docs/use-cases.md)
   - [Mobile UX](docs/mobile.md)
   - [UX for Compiler Creators](docs/compiler-ux.md)
   - [Repository Examples](docs/repo-examples.md)
   - [UI Design Fundamentals](docs/ui-design.md)
2. Each file is written in Markdown so you can read it directly on GitHub or in any text editor.

For a quick overview of the course, see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md), which lists each lesson with a short description. This repository is ideal for developers who want practical guidance on building user-friendly interfaces with clear, concise examples.

## Why Documentation Only?

A code-free approach keeps the focus on principles and methods rather than specific tools. Each lesson outlines practices you can apply in any language or framework. Copy the examples into your own projects and modify them to see how UX concepts translate to real code.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions or want to add additional examples, open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions that help clarify or expand the lessons are welcome.

## Course Structure

The project is organized so you can navigate directly through the `docs/` folder. Each file corresponds to a lesson, and the README within that directory provides an index of topics. Because there is no runtime code, you can download the repository and read it offline or print sections that you find useful.

## Feedback and Updates

User experience practices evolve as new devices and techniques appear. If you notice any outdated advice or want to suggest additional topics, feel free to open an issue. Your feedback helps keep the material relevant for everyone.
