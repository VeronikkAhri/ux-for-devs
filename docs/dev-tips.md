# 4. UX Tips for Developers

Even if you spend most of your time writing code, you play a vital role in crafting great user experiences. Keep these tips in mind:

- **Start with empathy:** Talk with your users or review feedback early in your development process.
- **Prototype quickly:** Use simple mockups or small scripts to test ideas before fully implementing them.
- **Focus on performance:** A fast, responsive application improves UX. Profile your code and watch for bottlenecks.
- **Document interactions:** Make it easy for other developers to understand how your interface should behave by writing comments and examples.
- **Iterate often:** Gather feedback and refine your work to meet user needs more effectively.

By thinking about UX while you code, you can build products that are more enjoyable and easier to use.
