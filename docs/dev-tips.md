# 4. UX Tips for Developers

Even if you spend most of your time writing code, you play a vital role in crafting great user experiences. Keep these tips in mind:

- **Start with empathy:** Talk with your users or review feedback early in your development process.
- **Prototype quickly:** Use simple mockups or small scripts to test ideas before fully implementing them.
- **Focus on performance:** A fast, responsive application improves UX. Profile your code and watch for bottlenecks.
- **Document interactions:** Make it easy for other developers to understand how your interface should behave by writing comments and examples.
- **Iterate often:** Gather feedback and refine your work to meet user needs more effectively.

## Coding for Better UX

1. **Keep your markup semantic.** Use proper HTML elements so assistive technologies understand your content.
2. **Structure your CSS logically.** Group related styles and avoid unnecessary complexity.
3. **Write accessible JavaScript.** Manage focus when modals open, and ensure keyboard shortcuts have clear alternatives.
4. **Test on multiple devices.** Simulators are good, but real devices reveal issues you might miss.
5. **Automate quality checks.** Linters and accessibility tools can catch problems before they reach users.

By thinking about UX while you code, you can build products that are more enjoyable and easier to use. Small improvements to readability, error handling, or performance can have a big impact on overall satisfaction.

## Working with Designers

- Involve designers early when discussing new features so that constraints are clear.
- Share prototypes or code snippets to illustrate behavior rather than just describing it.
- Respect design guidelines or style guides to keep the experience consistent across the product.

## Documenting UX Decisions

1. **Record the rationale** for interface changes in your commit messages or project tracker.
2. **Maintain screenshots** or short videos to show how features should behave.
3. **Link tickets** or bug reports to the UX principles they address so the intent is easy to understand.

## When to Refactor

- If you notice repeated code patterns that affect layout or interaction, consolidate them into reusable components.
- When feedback highlights confusion or slow performance, revisit the architecture to simplify.
- Schedule small refactoring tasks regularly so UX improvements donâ€™t pile up into a major overhaul.

These practices encourage a mindset where UX quality is part of everyday development, not an afterthought.
