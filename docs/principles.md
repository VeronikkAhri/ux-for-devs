# 2. UX Principles

Great UX comes from understanding how people think and behave. The following principles are a good starting point:

1. **Consistency** – Use familiar patterns and keep similar elements looking and acting the same across your app.
2. **Feedback** – Provide clear responses when users interact with your interface. This can be as simple as a button changing color when clicked.
3. **Simplicity** – Remove unnecessary steps and clutter. Keep the most important actions at the forefront.
4. **Accessibility** – Design with everyone in mind, including users with disabilities. This includes keyboard navigation, readable text, and proper color contrast.
5. **Hierarchy** – Guide the user's eye by emphasizing the most important elements first.

Understanding these principles can help you create intuitive experiences whether you are designing a web interface or building a command-line tool.
