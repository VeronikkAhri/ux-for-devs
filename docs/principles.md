# 2. UX Principles

Great UX comes from understanding how people think and behave. The following principles are a good starting point:

1. **Consistency** – Use familiar patterns and keep similar elements looking and acting the same across your app.
2. **Feedback** – Provide clear responses when users interact with your interface. This can be as simple as a button changing color when clicked.
3. **Simplicity** – Remove unnecessary steps and clutter. Keep the most important actions at the forefront.
4. **Accessibility** – Design with everyone in mind, including users with disabilities. This includes keyboard navigation, readable text, and proper color contrast.
5. **Hierarchy** – Guide the user's eye by emphasizing the most important elements first.
6. **User Control** – Allow people to undo actions or change settings so they feel comfortable experimenting.
7. **Context** – Present information at the moment it is needed. Avoid overloading users with details too early.

## Applying the Principles

Consider an example: when building a form, keep related fields together and provide clear labels (consistency). Offer immediate validation or error messages as users type (feedback). Limit the number of required fields to only the essentials (simplicity) and ensure the form works with assistive technologies (accessibility). Highlight the most important fields near the top (hierarchy), allow users to edit their submission (user control), and explain why the form is needed right on the page (context).

These principles work together to create interfaces that feel intuitive, whether you are designing a web app or building a command-line tool. Practice spotting them in the apps you use every day.
