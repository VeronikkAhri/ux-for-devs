# 1. Introduction

User experience (UX) is about creating products that are easy to use and delightful for people. This course covers the basics of UX design and how to apply it when writing code. You do not need a design background—just curiosity and a willingness to learn.

Think of UX as the bridge between human needs and the technical solutions you build. By considering how your audience thinks and what they expect, you can craft interfaces that feel natural and intuitive.

## Why UX Matters

- **User satisfaction:** A smooth experience keeps people engaged with your product.
- **Reduced support costs:** If your interface is straightforward, users are less likely to run into issues or require help.
- **Better adoption:** When a tool is easy to grasp, team members and customers are more likely to use it every day.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this course you will be able to:

- Describe core UX concepts.
- Identify common usability problems.
- Apply design thinking in your development process.
- Create interfaces that work for different types of users.
- Evaluate and iterate on designs through user feedback.

## How to Use This Course

Each file in the `docs/` folder is a lesson you can read in any order, though we recommend starting from the top. Grab a notebook or open a blank document to jot down ideas as you go. After each lesson, consider how you might apply the concepts to your own projects. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to spot improvements in your apps.

Above all, have fun exploring! UX is as much about creativity as it is about technical know-how. Challenge yourself to think like your users and build something they will love.

## Course Overview

This course is broken into short lessons so you can learn at your own pace. The documentation covers everything from foundational principles to hands-on examples. As you progress, compare what you learn with apps you use every day.

### Lesson Highlights
- **UX Principles:** Explore key ideas like consistency and hierarchy.
- **User Groups:** Learn how to design for kids, operators, and everyone in between.
- **Developer Tips:** Understand how small coding decisions impact usability.
- **Accessibility Basics:** Make your work inclusive and compliant.
- **Usability Testing:** Gather feedback to refine your ideas.

## Tips for Success

1. **Experiment often.** Try new approaches in small prototypes.
2. **Ask for feedback.** Share your designs with peers or users early on.
3. **Observe real behavior.** Pay attention to how people actually use your product.
4. **Document your process.** Keep notes on what works and what doesn’t for future reference.

## Additional Resources

Once you’ve finished the lessons, explore books and articles about UX research, design systems, and coding patterns. Communities like online forums or local meetups can also help you continue learning.

## UX vs. UI

People often use "UX" and "UI" interchangeably, but they represent different aspects of a product. **User experience** encompasses the overall feeling someone has when interacting with your application. **User interface** focuses on the visual and interactive elements like buttons, typography, and color. This course highlights the relationship between the two so you can design interfaces that look good and feel intuitive.

## The Design Thinking Process

1. **Empathize:** Start by researching your audience through interviews and observations.
2. **Define:** Summarize what users need and pinpoint the core problems you want to solve.
3. **Ideate:** Brainstorm multiple solutions without judging them. Encourage wild ideas to spark creativity.
4. **Prototype:** Turn the best concepts into lightweight prototypes—paper sketches, wireframes, or basic code.
5. **Test:** Share your prototypes with users to gather feedback and refine the concept.

You can repeat these steps as often as needed. Many teams cycle through them quickly to reach a polished solution.

## What This Course Does Not Cover

We focus on high-level UX methods and practical examples rather than specific frameworks or design tools. If you want in-depth tutorials on Sketch, Figma, or a particular frontend library, you may prefer a dedicated design or coding course. Here, you will gain a broad understanding of principles you can apply in any environment.

## Continuing Beyond the Course

Treat this repository as a springboard. Keep a design journal to document your observations about other apps, or start a side project to experiment with layout ideas. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes to think about users whenever you sit down to write code.
