# 1. Introduction

User experience (UX) is about creating products that are easy to use and delightful for people. This course covers the basics of UX design and how to apply it when writing code. You do not need a design backgroundâ€”just curiosity and a willingness to learn.

Think of UX as the bridge between human needs and the technical solutions you build. By considering how your audience thinks and what they expect, you can craft interfaces that feel natural and intuitive.

## Why UX Matters

- **User satisfaction:** A smooth experience keeps people engaged with your product.
- **Reduced support costs:** If your interface is straightforward, users are less likely to run into issues or require help.
- **Better adoption:** When a tool is easy to grasp, team members and customers are more likely to use it every day.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this course you will be able to:

- Describe core UX concepts.
- Identify common usability problems.
- Apply design thinking in your development process.
- Create interfaces that work for different types of users.
- Evaluate and iterate on designs through user feedback.

## How to Use This Course

Each file in the `docs/` folder is a lesson you can read in any order, though we recommend starting from the top. Grab a notebook or open a blank document to jot down ideas as you go. After each lesson, consider how you might apply the concepts to your own projects. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to spot improvements in your apps.

Above all, have fun exploring! UX is as much about creativity as it is about technical know-how. Challenge yourself to think like your users and build something they will love.
