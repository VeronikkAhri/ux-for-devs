# 9. Mobile UX

Designing for mobile devices introduces unique challenges. Consider these guidelines when creating apps or responsive websites:

- **Prioritize key tasks** so users can accomplish goals quickly on smaller screens.
- **Use touch-friendly controls** with adequate spacing to prevent accidental taps.
- **Optimize performance** by minimizing file sizes and reducing network requests.
- **Support offline use** when possible, caching essential data for spotty connections.
- **Design for different orientations** and test across devices to ensure layouts adapt gracefully.
- **Leverage native capabilities** like camera access and push notifications thoughtfully.

Keep the experience lightweight and intuitive so people can engage with your product anywhere.
