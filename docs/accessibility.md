# 6. Accessibility Basics

Accessibility ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use your application. Keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Provide text alternatives** for images, icons, and media so screen readers can describe them.
- **Use sufficient color contrast** between text and backgrounds to make content readable for users with low vision.
- **Support keyboard navigation** so all interactive elements can be reached without a mouse.
- **Label form fields clearly** and group related inputs to help users complete tasks without confusion.
- **Test with assistive technologies** like screen readers to verify your interface works for all users.

Building accessibility into your workflow leads to products that are inclusive and easier for everyone to use.
