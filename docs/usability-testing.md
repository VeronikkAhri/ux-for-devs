# 7. Usability Testing

Testing your designs with real users helps uncover issues you might miss on your own. Start small and iterate:

1. **Plan your test.** Pick a few tasks you want users to perform and prepare questions to learn about their experience.
2. **Recruit participants.** Aim for five to six people who represent your target audience. Even a small number can reveal major problems.
3. **Observe carefully.** Watch how users interact with your prototype or product. Encourage them to think aloud so you understand their thought process.
4. **Take notes.** Record where they struggle or succeed. Look for patterns across participants.
5. **Refine the design.** Use the results to improve your interface, then test again.

Iterative testing keeps your project user-focused and leads to a smoother final product.
