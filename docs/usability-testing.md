# 7. Usability Testing

Testing your designs with real users helps uncover issues you might miss on your own. Start small and iterate:

1. **Plan your test.** Pick a few tasks you want users to perform and prepare questions to learn about their experience.
2. **Recruit participants.** Aim for five to six people who represent your target audience. Even a small number can reveal major problems.
3. **Observe carefully.** Watch how users interact with your prototype or product. Encourage them to think aloud so you understand their thought process.
4. **Take notes.** Record where they struggle or succeed. Look for patterns across participants.
5. **Refine the design.** Use the results to improve your interface, then test again.

## Remote vs In-Person

- **Remote testing** lets you reach people anywhere in the world through screen sharing or dedicated tools. It is convenient but requires clear instructions.
- **In-person sessions** allow you to notice body language and pick up subtle cues, though scheduling can be more difficult.

## Analyzing Results

After each session, summarize what you observed. Focus on high-impact issues that multiple participants encountered. Share your findings with the team and brainstorm solutions. Small iterations based on user feedback lead to big improvements over time.

Iterative testing keeps your project user-focused and leads to a smoother final product.

## Recruitment Tips

- Reach out to existing users through newsletters or social media.
- Offer small incentives or early access to new features for participants.
- Screen participants to ensure a range of experience levels with your product.

## Ethics in Testing

1. **Gain consent** before recording or sharing any participant information.
2. **Respect privacy** by anonymizing results when presenting findings.
3. **Be transparent** about how feedback will be used to shape the product.

## Tools for the Job

- Remote testing platforms can record screen interactions and gather voice comments.
- Simple survey tools help collect feedback in a structured format.
- Issue trackers make it easy to assign tasks and track fixes uncovered during sessions.

Combining ethical practices with the right tools makes testing feel safe and productive for both you and your participants.
