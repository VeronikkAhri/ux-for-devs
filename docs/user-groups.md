# 3. Designing for Different Users

Different groups of people may use your productâ€”kids, adults, operators, developers, and everyone in between. Consider their unique needs:

- **Kids:** Make interfaces playful with large buttons and minimal text. Use bright colors and provide guidance through friendly illustrations.
- **Operators:** Focus on efficiency and clarity. Provide keyboard shortcuts and clear status indicators so tasks can be performed quickly.
- **Developers:** Offer useful error messages and documentation. Developers appreciate tools that are both powerful and easy to configure.
- **General Users:** Ensure content is readable and interactions are intuitive. Provide helpful tips or onboarding to reduce confusion.

The more you empathize with each user group, the better your design decisions will be.
