## How to Navigate the Course

Start with the introduction, then progress through the topics at your own pace. Many sections reference one another, so feel free to jump between them as needed. The examples file includes small code snippets that demonstrate key ideas from the other lessons.

If youâ€™re new to UX, focus on the principles and accessibility guides first. Developers looking to refine their skills may want to dive straight into the dev tips and usability testing sections.

## About the Examples

Throughout the course, you will find snippets in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These examples are intentionally simple so you can adapt them to your preferred framework or language. Copy the code directly into a sandbox environment and tweak it to see how small changes affect usability.

## Looking for More Help?

If you have questions while working through the lessons, consider opening an issue on the repository or starting a discussion with fellow learners. Sharing what you discover can help others who are new to UX as well.

## Course Philosophy

This project encourages a hands-on approach. Read through the lessons, try the example code, and adapt it to your own stack. Because there is no runtime, you are free to experiment with frameworks or languages you already know. Keep notes about your progress so you can reference them later.

## Additional Reading

At the end of each lesson you will find links to external articles, books, or videos that expand on the topics discussed. Take time to explore these resources if you want to deepen your understanding or see how other teams tackle similar UX challenges.
